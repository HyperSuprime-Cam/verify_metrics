This directory contains *metric definition* YAML files for each EUPS package that produces metric measurements.

Files are named after the EUPS package.
For example: ``validate_drp.yaml`` for the `validate_drp`_ package.

The format of these YAML files is *currently* documented in https://sqr-017.lsst.io/index.html#metric-yaml.

.. _validate_drp: https://github.com/lsst/validate_drp
