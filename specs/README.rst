This directory contains *specification definition* YAML files for metrics defined in ``../metrics``.
Specifications are organized into sub-directories, each named after the corresponding package in ``../metrics``.
For a single package, specifications can be distributed across multiple YAML files and even sub-directories.
The READMEs of each specification sub-directory should state how specifications are organized to suggest where new specifications can be added.

For more information about the format of specification definition YAML files, see https://sqr-017.lsst.io/index.html#spec-yaml.
